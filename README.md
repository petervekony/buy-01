## Safe-Zone

Safe-Zone is the fifth project in the java track of 01Edu's curriculum. The goal
of the project is to set up SonarQube for static code analysis for the
[**buy-01**](https://github.com/petervekony/buy-01) project we created earlier
and implement it in the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. We also had to implement the
quality gate functionality and make sure that when we introduce new code into
the code base that is not up to the quality gate requirements, it will trigger a
failure in the pipeline, so it doesn't make it into production.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to the [**SonarQube dashboard**](http://64.226.78.45:9000)

#### SonarQube

After logging in on the SonarQube dashboard you can check out the analysis of
all the current backend microservices (user-service, product-service,
media-service) and the frontend. If there are any potential bugs, security
vulnerabilities, hotspots or code smells recognized, you can see them under the
'overall code' tab in each project. You can also see the percentage of
duplicated lines and test coverage.

#### Infrastructure

SonarQube is running on a Digital Ocean droplet. For this entire project
(buy-01, Jenkins and SonarQube) we have three separate droplets set up.

## MR-JENK

#### About

Mr-jenk is the fourth project in the java track of 01Edu's curriculum. The goal
of the project is to create a CI/CD pipeline for the
[**buy-01**](https://github.com/petervekony/buy-01) project we created earlier.
The project uses Jenkins, JUnit, Karma, Jasmine, Github webhooks and Docker to
fully automate the process of testing and deploying the code to
[**production environment.**](https://thewarehouse.rocks)

#### Prerequisites

To run and view the project you'll need:

- Access to the [**Jenkins dashboard**](http://164.90.167.77:8080)
- Access to the repository, to push changes to main branch

#### Running the project

- You can go to [**Jenkins dashboard**](http://164.90.167.77:8080) to manually
  trigger build & deployment
- You can make changes to the codebase and push the changes to main to trigger
  the build & deployment

#### Pipeline design

- When there's a push to main, github sends notification to the Jenkins server
  and that triggers the build
- You can see all the steps in the [**Jenkinsfile**](Jenkinsfile)
- First step is to pull the new code from the repo
- Then run the tests to make sure everything works
- If tests pass, Jenkins switches to deploy server, pulls the code, builds the
  images and spins up the containers
- Deploy server waits that all the containers are up and running (healthy),
  before marking the build succesfull.
- If something goes wrong in deployment, the rollback will kick in and build the
  images and spin up containers from the last succesfull build
- After build has completed, Jenkins will send email notifications to team
  members, with the status of the build

#### Infrastructure

- For this fairly simple pipeline, we are using two Digital Ocean Droplets. One
  for the Jenkins and one for the deployment. All communication between the
  machines take place using SSH.

# buy-01

## About

Buy-01 is the third project in the java track of 01Edu's curriculum. The goal of
the project is to create a mini e-commerce site using MongoDB, the Spring Boot
java framework and Angular, where sellers can add products they want to sell,
add images to them, while users can browse the products and contact the seller
if they want to buy something. The backend has to be separated into
microservices (user, product and media at least).

## Prerequisites

To run the project on your own machine, you need:

- Docker installed
- access to a MongoDB cluster

### MongoDB

To run the project with your own database, you either need to have access to a
cluster on Atlas, run mongoDB on your machine, or uncomment the mongo service in
the docker-compose.yml file.

Either way you choose, you have to configure your own database connection URI in
the docker-compose file for each of the backend services.

## Running the project

You need to provide an environment file to the docker-compose command for the
cookies and the ssl certificate to work. A self signed certificate to run it
locally is provided, run these commands in the terminal from the project's root
directory:

Building the images:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.dev build
```

Running them:

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.dev up
```

### Note about running the project on ARM64 architecture

If you are running the project on an Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3), because of the
lack of the imageio-webp support, only jpeg file upload works. On any other
architecture jpeg, png and webp files can be uploaded.

## Kafka

Backend microservices communicate with each other via Apache Kafka to handle JWT
token validation. Validated tokens are cached for a short time to save time.
Some other actions also depend on Kafka:

- Media deletion upon product or user deletion
- Product deletion upon user deletion
- Authorization checks for media and product creation, update and deletion

## API Access

The angular frontend runs on port _443_ using HTTPS. From localhost the API
endpoints are also accessible using an API tool like Postman. An nginx reverse
proxy handles the routing of the request towards the proper microservices.

The main endpoints are

- /api/auth
- /api/users
- /api/products
- /api/media

### Authentication endpoints

#### POST: /api/signup

```json
{
  "name": "chosenName",
  "email": "your@email.com",
  "password": "yourPassword",
  "role": "CLIENT/SELLER"
}
```

#### POST: /api/signin

```json
{
  "name": "chosenName",
  "password": "yourPassword"
}
```

#### POST: /api/signout

An empty post request with the buy-01 cookie in the "Cookie" header sends an
immediately expiring cookie in the response, thus forcing the browser to delete
the existing cookie. Since the API is stateless, it doesn't keep any blacklists,
so the original token still works until the original expiry date.

### User endpoints (require authentication first)

All these endpoints require a cookie with a valid JWT token in the "Cookie"
header.

#### GET: /api/users

Gets all the users in the database.

#### GET: /api/users/{id}

Gets the user specified by the {id}

#### PUT: /api/users/{id}

Users can update their own user details by sending a json object in the request
body and specifying the {id}. The fields are the same as in the authentication
signup request, excluding the role. Only the fields to be updated are necessary,
null fields are ignored. Users cannot update their role, it is ignored. Users
can only update their own details.

#### DELETE: /api/users/{id}

Users can delete their account by specifying their {id}. When a user is deleted,
all products (if there is any) and all media belonging to the user is deleted.

### Product endpoint

All these endpoints require a cookie with a valid JWT token in the "Cookie"
header.

#### GET: /api/products

Gets all the products in the database.

#### GET: /api/products/{id}

Gets a product specified by the {id}.

#### PUT: /api/products/{id}

Product update works the same way as the user update, null fields are ignored.
UserId cannot be updated.

#### DELETE: /api/products/{id}

Sellers can delete their own products by specifying the {id}. All media
belonging to a product is deleted upon product deletion.

### Media endpoints

All these endpoints require a cookie with a valid JWT token in the "Cookie"
header.

#### GET: /api/media/{productId}

Gets all the media belonging to the product specified by the {productId}.

#### GET: /api/media/product/{productId}

Gets a thumbnail image (the first media stored in the database belonging to the
product resized to a maximum 400x400 size). Previous thumbnail requests are
cached in the backend to save processing time.

#### GET: /api/media/user/{userId}

Gets the avatar of the user specified by the {userId}.

#### POST: /api/media?userId={userId}&productId={productId}

**[Apple Silicon: see the note](#arm64note)**

Media can be created belonging to the user (avatar) or product. For product, 6
images can be uploaded. Supported file types are jpeg, png and non-animated
webp. Gif files can be uploaded, but all file types are converted into jpeg to
save storage space. From the query parameters, only one can be specified, the
other has to be left out.

The image has to be submitted as form-data, as a Multipart File with 'image' as
name.

#### DELETE: /api/media/{id}

Deletes media specified by {id}. Users can only delete media belonging to them.

#### DELETE: /api/media?userId={userId}&productId={productId}

Deletes all media belonging to either the user specified by {userId} or the
product specified by {productId}. Only one can be specified, the other has to be
left out.
